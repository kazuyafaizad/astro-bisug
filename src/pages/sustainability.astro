                <p>Swiftlets will never use the same nest twice after raising their chicks. Therefore, the nest is a sustainable resource and with proper care, it’s harvesting does not jeopardize the birds themselves or their environment. </p>
                <p>Proper harvesting is mutually beneficial to both humans and swiftlets. Allowing the swiftlets to raise their young before harvesting their nests ensures the future of their species, and the future of bird’s nests as a resource.</p>

        <p>As a rule, humankind must return what we take from the environment. Since BI-SU began, we have taken efforts to consistently donate a portion of our sales to protect Borneo’s wildlife. In recognition of this, we are honored to have received a letter of appreciation from the Malaysian government and a Certificate of Authenticity for our harvesting activities. </p>
        <p>Moving forward, we strive ever further to help protect the environment, holding donation drives for the preservation of Bornean forests every year. As we take, so to do we give back. This is our goal. This is our creed.</p>
