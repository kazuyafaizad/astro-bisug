                <p>Swiftlets will never use the same nest twice after raising their chicks. Therefore, the nest is a sustainable resource and with proper care, it’s harvesting does not jeopardize the birds themselves or their environment. </p>
                <p>Proper harvesting is mutually beneficial to both humans and swiftlets. Allowing the swiftlets to raise their young before harvesting their nests ensures the future of their species, and the future of bird’s nests as a resource.</p>
